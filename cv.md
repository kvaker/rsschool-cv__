About
-----------
I’m applying to the program FED at the RS because I’m very interested in the idea of working and learning distance in teams with the another learners, school teachers and people who have a knowledge of coding and web developing.
I believe my knowledge and skills will serve to allow me new experience with Java Script, HTML, CSS.
My strengths are:
   * creative
   * disciplined/focused
   * self-control  
   * continuous Learning

My code
-----------
```javascript
const removeSmallest = (numbers) => {
  const index = numbers.reduce((acc,cur,ind,arr) => cur < arr[acc] ? ind : acc, 0);
  return numbers.filter((e, i) => i !== index);
}
```
